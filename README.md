# huffman-coding
Builds a prototype of data compressing/decompressing tool under Huffman coding scheme with a simple GUI (English), for educational purpose only.

There are two testing text files in the examples directory, one in Chinese (西游记) and the other in English (Pride and Prejudice). Each is associated with four files: original (*.txt), compressed data generated by tool (*.dat), recovered file by the decompressor (*_recovered.txt), and a zip file (*.txt.zip).
